# Maze-Generation
Makes mazes. Very incomplete, only one working implementation as of 6/1/20

Currently implemented algorithms:

Hashing Prims algorithm: Hashes a given key with the size of the maze in order to make reproducible mazes. The same size maze with the same key gets you the same maze

Half a Wilsons algorithm: Ive found it too hard to get wilsons algorithm running efficiently with the framework I have set up.
