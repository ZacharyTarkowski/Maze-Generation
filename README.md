# Maze-Generation
Makes a maze using various algorithms.

Currently implemented algorithms:

Prims algorithm: Hashes a given key in order to make reproducible mazes. The same size maze with the same key gets you the same maze.

Half a Wilsons algorithm: Ive found it too hard to get wilsons algorithm running efficiently with the framework I have set up.
